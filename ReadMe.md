## Special long-lived branches

### Fieldworks

Based on the 54.1 release tag, this branch contains some specific changes for the [Fieldworks project](https://github.com/sillsdev/fieldworks)

### MinimumStaticallyLinked*

These branches are based on -- but have two major differences from -- the 54.1 or whatever release tags:

- It is a "minimum" build as described [here](https://github.com/sillsdev/icu-dotnet#windows-1)
- It is statically linked to remove the dependency on the C++ Redistributable
  - This is accomplished by setting the runtime library in each .vcxproj file to MultiThreaded rather than MultiThreadedDLL

### FullStaticallyLinked*

These branches are based on -- but have one major differences from -- the 54.1 or whatever release tags:

- It is statically linked to remove the dependency on the C++ Redistributable
  - This is accomplished by setting the runtime library in each .vcxproj file to MultiThreaded rather than MultiThreadedDLL
